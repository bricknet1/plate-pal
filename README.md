# Plate Pal - Cook what you've got

## Description

This is a CLI application allowing users to see a list of recipes they can make with the ingredients they already have at home. Users can:
- Enter ingredients one-by-one until they enter everything they have
- View a list of recipes they can make based on the ingredients they have
- Select a recipe from the list in order to see the instructions for that recipe

## Installation

From the primary directory, open the terminal and run:
```
$ pipenv install
```
Then, from the same directory, run:
```
$ pipenv shell
```

To run the application, navigate to the "lib" directory and run:
```
$ python cli.py
```

## Functionality

#### create_ingredients_table
This generates the complete list of ingredients that the user can select from.
